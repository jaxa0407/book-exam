        "description": "Understand Kubernetes and other orchestration systems deeply by building your own using Go and the Docker API. Orchestration systems like Kubernetes coordinate other software subsystems and services to create a complete organized system. Although orchestration tools have a reputation for complexity, they’re designed around few important patterns that apply across many aspects of software development. Build an Orchestrator in Go reveals the inner workings of orchestration frameworks by guiding you as you design and implement your own using the Go SDK. As you create your own orchestration framework, you’ll improve your understanding of Kubernetes and its role in distributed system design. You’ll also build the skills required to design custom orchestration solutions for those times when an out-of-the-box solution isn’t a good fit. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.",

This book will teach you how to implement Pachyderm to create collaborative data science workflows and reproduce your ML experiments at scale. You'll begin your journey by exploring the importance of data reproducibility and comparing different data science platforms. Next, you'll explore how Pachyderm fits into the picture and its significance, followed by learning how to install Pachyderm locally on your computer or a cloud platform of your choice. You'll then discover the architectural components and Pachyderm's main pipeline principles and concepts. The book demonstrates how to use Pachyderm components to create your first data pipeline and advances to cover common operations involving data, such as uploading data to and from Pachyderm to create more complex pipelines. Based on what you've learned, you'll develop an end-to-end ML workflow, before trying out the hyperparameter tuning technique and the different supported Pachyderm language clients. Finally, you'll learn how to use a SaaS version of Pachyderm with Pachyderm Notebooks. By the end of this book, you will learn all aspects of running your data pipelines in Pachyderm and manage them on a day-to-day basis. What you will learnUnderstand the importance of reproducible data science for enterpriseExplore the basics of Pachyderm, such as commits and branchesUpload data to and from PachydermImplement common pipeline operations in PachydermCreate a real-life example of hyperparameter tuning in PachydermCombine Pachyderm with Pachyderm language clients in Python and GoWho this book is for This book is for new as well as experienced data scientists and machine learning engineers who want to build scalable infrastructures for their data science projects.

Walaupun demikian, buku ini dapat pula digunakan bagi siswa politeknik dan para bidang teknik secara umum. Buku ini dirancang berdasarkan pengalaman mengajar di Universitas Islam Negeri Walisongo Semarang. Buku ini memuat prinsip dan konsep dasar bahasa pemograman Go yang disajikan secara jelas, padat, dan komprehensif. Go diciptakan oleh Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, dan Ken Thompson di Google pada tahun 2007. Buku ini merupakan referensi untuk bahasa pemrograman Go dan menjelaskan semua elemen bahasa dan menggambarkan penggunaannya dengan contoh kode, serta diberi fitur video tutorial supaya pembaca dapat belajar secara mandiri. Diharapkan buku ini dapat membantu dalam mengembangkan bahasa pemograman Go tidak hanya di ilmu sains, tetapi juga di teknik, kesehatan, dan bidang lainnya. Tidak ada akhir untuk belajar di dunia komputer sains, di mana alat dan teknik terus berubah dan meningkat. Siapapun Anda, sudah memiliki gelar atau baru memulai (mahasiswa), terus belajar dan memperbarui pengetahuan itu penting. Saya harap buku ini dapat bermanfaat sebagai fondasi Anda yang ingin mempelajari bahasa pemrograman Go. “Jangan pernah puas memperbarui ilmu dan mengimplementasikannya untuk sesuatu yang baik.” -- Fachrizal Rian Pratama",

Flutter achieves this with an elegant design and a wealth of third-party plugins, making it the future of mobile app development. If you are a mobile developer who wants to create rich and expressive native apps with the latest Google Flutter framework, this book is for you. This book will guide you through developing your first app from scratch all the way to production release. Starting with the setup of your development environment, you'll learn about your app's UI design and responding to user input via Flutter widgets, manage app navigation and screen transitions, and create widget animations. You'll then explore the rich set of third party-plugins, including Firebase and Google Maps, and get to grips with testing and debugging. Finally, you'll get up to speed with releasing your app to mobile stores and the web. By the end of this Flutter book, you'll have gained the confidence to create, edit, test, and release a full Flutter app on your own. What you will learnExplore the core concepts of the Flutter framework and how it is used for cross-platform developmentUnderstand the fundamentals of the Dart programming languageWork with Flutter widgets and learn the concepts of stateful and stateless widgetsAdd animation to your app using animated widgets and advanced animations techniquesMaster the complete development lifecycle, including testing and debuggingInvestigate the app release process to both mobile stores and the webWho this book is for This book is for developers looking to learn Google's revolutionary framework Flutter from scratch. No prior knowledge of Flutter or Dart is required.",

        "description": "Journey into the amazing world of WebAssembly (Wasm) and learn about how it can be applied on the cloud. This book is an introduction to Wasm aimed at professionals accustomed to working with cloud-related technologies such as Kubernetes and Istio service mesh. Author Shashank Jain begins with an introduction to Wasm and its related tooling such as wasm-bindgen and wapc. He then walks you through code examples using Rust, Golang, and JavaScript to demonstrate how they can be compiled to Wasm and consumed from Wasm runtimes deployed standalone, as well as on the cloud. You will see how a wasm module can be run through an http interface, and how Wasm fits into CNCF projects such as Kubernetes and Istio service mesh. After that, you’ll learn how the polyglot nature of WebAssembly can be leveraged through examples written in languages like Rust and consumed via Golang and JavaScript, with a focus on how WebAssembly allows interoperability between them. You’ll gain an understanding of how Wasm-based modules can be deployed inside Linux containers and orchestrated via Kubernetes, and how Wasm can be used within the Istio proxy to apply rules and filters. After reading this book, you’ll have the knowledge necessary to apply WebAssembly to create multi tenanted workloads which can be polyglot in nature and can be deployed on cloud environments like Kubernetes. What You Will Learn Understand how Wasm can be used for server-side applications Learn about Wasm memory model and Wasm module layout How communication between host and Wasm module is facilitated The basics of Wasm sandboxing and security The fundamentals of tooling around Wasm, such as WAT and Wasm-pack Create a Wasm module in Rust and consume it from JavaScript, Rust and Golang. Grasp how Kubernetes can be used to orchestrate Wasm-based workloads How Wasm fits into service mesh Who Is This Book For Software developers/architects who are looking to hone their skills in virtualization and explore alternatives to Docker and container-based technologies for their workload deployments. Readers should have a basic programming background in languages such as Rust and Golang to get the most out of this book.",
